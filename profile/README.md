Welcome to the Computation, Cognition, and Movement Lab! :raised_hands:

We are a team of researchers trying to better understand how we (humans) acquire, adapt, and refine motor skills. In addition to our motor learning research, we are also interested in developing open-source tools that can benefit researchers regardless of discipline, like our Python package for Bayesian statistics [bayes-toolbox](https://github.com/hyosubkim/bayes-toolbox). To learn more about what we do, please check out our [lab webpage](https://ccmlab.org/).
